If I drink more than 2 glasses of OJ I get nauseous, don't know why yet, but it never happened before I started on the medication, so I place the reason there. It is very important to reduce junk food and fast carbs and high fat foods when on metformin, that is the exact reason why you get the tummy issues. The junk food wants to raise your blood sugar and the metformin is trying to lower it. It's a battle in your insides where the drug wins. Messily, LOL. I have lost weight as well, about 11 pounds with minimal exercise but I feel I've plataued so I'm going to be going to the gym now.

If you eat food with a high glycemic index, that food doesn't get digested by you- it sits in your GI tract and gets fermented by bacteria. Hence the blaoting and diarrhea.

Bile is produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and secreted into the intestines in order to absorb fats into the bloodstream. One possible reason for the GI problems is that metformin reduces normal reabsorption of bile from the intestines back into the bloodstream, which causes elevated bile salt concentrations in the colon.(25) Most studies suggest that colonic bile salts cause free radical damage to DNA and may contribute to colon cancer. In addition, bile acids may stimulate cells in the colon to produce leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a highly inflammatory substance. LTB4 would be a contributor to any intestinal inflammatory condition.(28) Byproducts of bacterial action on bile salts may lead to intestinal cell damage and absorption of ""foreign"" molecules such as food or bacteria particles into the bloodsteam, possibly causing allergies and other immune responses.
